# FX Translation Advisor — Reference Skill

## Purpose

Provide the complete multi-jurisdiction framework for foreign currency translation and remeasurement advisory — from functional currency determination through method selection, CTA routing, highly inflationary economy treatment, net investment hedge interactions, and jurisdictional FX control overlays.

---

## Part 1: Functional Currency Determination

### ASC 830-10-45 (US GAAP) and IAS 21.9–21.14 (IFRS)

The **functional currency** is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. Determination uses a hierarchy of indicators:

**Primary indicators (IAS 21.9 / ASC 830-10-45-2):**

| Indicator | Question |
|---|---|
| Sales price currency | In which currency are sales prices denominated and settled? |
| Sales market currency | Which currency dominates the competitive environment in which the entity sells? |
| Labor and material cost currency | In which currency are the entity's principal costs (labor, materials) denominated and settled? |

**Secondary indicators (IAS 21.10 / ASC 830-10-45-4):**

| Indicator | Question |
|---|---|
| Financing currency | In which currency are debt instruments denominated and settled? |
| Cash flow currency | In which currency are receipts from operating activities usually retained? |

**Group entity indicators (IAS 21.11):**
- Is the foreign operation an extension of the parent's activities (parent's currency indicators dominate)?
- Or does it operate with significant autonomy (local currency indicators dominate)?

**Conflict resolution:**
- When primary and secondary indicators conflict, judgment is required.
- IAS 21.12 provides that management uses judgment to determine the currency that most faithfully represents the economic effects of transactions, events, and conditions.
- ASC 830-10-45-6: when indicators conflict, management considers the totality of the facts.

**Functional currency once determined:**
- IAS 21.13: once determined, the functional currency does not change unless there is a change in the underlying transactions, events, and conditions.
- ASC 830-10-45-7: change in functional currency is treated prospectively from the date of the change.

---

## Part 2: Translation Method vs. Remeasurement Method

### The Two-Step Framework

**Step 1 — Is the entity's record-keeping currency the same as its functional currency?**
- No → Apply **remeasurement** (temporal method) to convert records into functional currency first.
- Yes → Proceed to Step 2.

**Step 2 — Is the functional currency the same as the parent's presentation currency?**
- No → Apply **translation** (current rate method) to convert functional currency statements into presentation currency.
- Yes → No translation required.

---

### Remeasurement (Temporal Method)

**When it applies**: foreign currency records ≠ functional currency (entity keeps books in a currency that is not its functional currency).

**Rate assignment — ASC 830-10-45-17 / IAS 21.23–21.24:**

| Item Category | Rate |
|---|---|
| Monetary assets (cash, receivables, payables, debt) | **Closing rate** (balance sheet date) |
| Non-monetary assets carried at historical cost (inventory at cost, PP&E, goodwill, intangibles) | **Historical rate** (rate at date of transaction) |
| Non-monetary assets carried at fair value (investment properties at FV, equity securities at FV) | **Rate at date of fair value measurement** |
| Income statement items related to non-monetary items (COGS, depreciation, amortization) | **Historical rate** (matching the underlying asset) |
| Other income statement items (revenue, operating expenses not linked to non-monetary items) | **Average rate** for the period (or transaction date rate if more appropriate) |

**P&L impact**: remeasurement gains and losses go to **P&L** (not OCI).
- ASC 830-20-35-1: transaction gains and losses on monetary items → P&L.
- IAS 21.28: exchange differences on monetary items → P&L in the period.

---

### Translation (Current Rate Method)

**When it applies**: functional currency ≠ presentation currency (entity translates its functional-currency statements into the parent's presentation currency).

**Rate assignment — ASC 830-30-45-3 / IAS 21.39–21.42:**

| Item Category | Rate |
|---|---|
| Assets (all) | **Closing rate** (balance sheet date) |
| Liabilities (all) | **Closing rate** (balance sheet date) |
| Income statement items (revenue, expenses, gains, losses) | **Average rate** for the period (or transaction date rate if exchange rates fluctuate significantly) |
| Equity components (share capital, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings at time of investment) | **Historical rate** (rate at date of investment or transaction) |
| Dividends declared | **Rate at declaration date** |

**OCI routing**: the net translation difference is the **Cumulative Translation Adjustment (CTA)**:
- ASC 830-30-45-12: CTA → accumulated in OCI (AOCI); not reclassified to P&L until disposal of the foreign operation.
- IAS 21.39: translation differences → OCI (Translation Reserve); recycled to P&L on disposal (IAS 21.48).

---

## Part 3: CTA Accumulation, Disposal, and Recycling

### Accumulation in OCI

CTA accumulates in OCI for each period that:
- The foreign operation exists with a functional currency different from the parent's presentation currency.
- Exchange rates differ between the opening and closing balance sheet dates.

### Disposal — CTA Recycling

**IFRS (IAS 21.48):**
- On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative CTA related to that operation is **reclassified from OCI to P&L** (recycled) as a reclassification adjustment.
- IAS 21.48C: on partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the entity reclassifies a proportionate share of the CTA to the non-controlling interest.

**US GAAP (ASC 830-30-40-1):**
- On sale or liquidation of a foreign operation, the **pro-rata portion of the CTA** related to that operation is **released from AOCI and recognized in P&L**.
- Key difference from IFRS: under US GAAP, partial disposal of a subsidiary does not trigger partial CTA reclassification unless the subsidiary is deconsolidated. ASC 830-30-40 requires full deconsolidation or sale to trigger release.

### Long-Term Monetary Intragroup Items (IAS 21.32)

**IAS 21.32**: exchange differences on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation (i.e., long-term intragroup loans with no scheduled repayment) → OCI (not P&L) at the consolidated level.
- At the individual entity level, these may be recognized in P&L.
- The OCI election applies only in consolidated financial statements.

**US GAAP equivalent (ASC 830-20-35-3)**: long-term intercompany transactions that are of an investment nature → CTA in OCI at the consolidated level (same result, different articulation).

---

## Part 4: Highly Inflationary Economies

### ASC 830-10-45-11 (US GAAP)

**Trigger**: cumulative three-year inflation rate > 100%.

**Consequence**: the foreign entity's functional currency is **replaced by the parent's reporting currency** (USD for a US parent) for accounting purposes. The entity must then **remeasure** using the temporal method with USD as the functional currency.

**Practical implication**: non-monetary items (PP&E, inventory) retain their historical USD cost basis; no translation adjustment in OCI — all differences go to P&L.

**Affected jurisdictions (as of 2025–2026):**
- **Argentina**: designated highly inflationary for US GAAP purposes; also IAS 29 hyperinflationary.
- **Turkey**: designated highly inflationary for US GAAP purposes; IAS 29 applied from 1 January 2022.
- Monitor: Ethiopia, Haiti, Iran, Lebanon, South Sudan, Sudan, Venezuela, Yemen, Zimbabwe — verify current status against published indices.

### IAS 29 (IFRS) — Hyperinflationary Economies

**Trigger**: IAS 29.3 indicators include cumulative inflation rate over three years approaching or exceeding 100%, but judgment is required across qualitative indicators including:
- General population preferring to keep wealth in non-monetary assets or relatively stable currencies.
- Monetary amounts stated in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency.
- Interest, wages, and prices linked to a price index.
- Three-year cumulative inflation approaching or exceeding 100%.

**Consequence**: financial statements (including comparatives) are **restated to the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date** using a general price index. Non-monetary items are adjusted by applying the change in the general price index from the date of acquisition.

**IAS 29.8**: all items in the statement of financial position not already expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date are restated by applying a general price index.

**Key difference from ASC 830**: IAS 29 restates the financial statements (purchasing power restatement); ASC 830-10-45-11 changes the functional currency designation and applies temporal method remeasurement. These are different mechanical approaches.

## Part 5: Net Investment Hedge Accounting

### ASC 830-20 / IAS 21.32 and Interaction with ASC 815 / IFRS 9

**Net investment in a foreign operation** = the reporting entity's interest in the net assets of a foreign operation.

**Hedge of net investment:**

| Framework | Standard | Hedge gain/loss routing |
|---|---|---|
| US GAAP | ASC 830-20-35-3 + ASC 815-35-1 | Effective portion → OCI (CTA); reclassified to P&L on disposal of the investment |
| IFRS | IAS 21.32 + IFRS 9.6.5.13 | Effective portion → OCI (Translation Reserve); recycled to P&L on disposal |

**Eligible hedging instruments:**
- Foreign currency-denominated debt instruments (non-derivative hedging instruments).
- Foreign currency forward contracts or cross-currency swaps (derivative hedging instruments).

**Designation requirements:**
- The hedged item is the net assets of the foreign operation, not individual assets/liabilities.
- Hedge must be formally documented and assessed for effectiveness.

## Part 6: Multi-GAAP Comparison Table

| Area | US GAAP (ASC 830) | IFRS (IAS 21) | German HGB | JGAAP (ASBJ No. 22) | CAS 19 (China) | Ind AS 21 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Translation method | Current rate for all A/L; average for P&L; historical for equity | Same as US GAAP | Closing rate for A/L; historical for equity; average or closing for P&L (simplified) | Broadly similar to IFRS; closing rate for A/L; average for P&L | Similar to IAS 21; closing for A/L; average for P&L | Converged with IAS 21; minor carve-outs |
| CTA in OCI | Yes — AOCI; no P&L recycling until disposal | Yes — Translation Reserve; **recycled to P&L on disposal** | No explicit OCI concept; translation differences generally recognized in equity reserve (§ 308a HGB) | Translation differences → OCI; recycled to P&L on disposal (similar to IFRS) | Translation differences → OCI; recycled on disposal (similar to IAS 21) | Same as IAS 21 — recycled on disposal |
| Remeasurement (temporal) gain/loss | P&L | P&L (IAS 21.28) | P&L | P&L | P&L | P&L |
| Highly inflationary | Change functional currency to USD (ASC 830-10-45-11) | IAS 29 restatement to current purchasing power | No specific guidance; general prudence principle applies | No specific guidance | Broadly follows IAS 29 concept | Follows IAS 29 |
| Long-term intragroup monetary items | OCI at consolidated level (ASC 830-20-35-3) | OCI at consolidated level (IAS 21.32); P&L at entity level | P&L | P&L (no OCI election available) | Similar to IAS 21 | Same as IAS 21 |
| CTA recycling on partial disposal of subsidiary | Only on full deconsolidation (ASC 830-30-40) | Proportionate share reclassified (IAS 21.48C) | N/A | Similar to IFRS | Similar to IAS 21 | Same as IAS 21 |

## Part 7: Jurisdictional FX Control Overlays

### China — SAFE (State Administration of Foreign Exchange)

**Relevant to FX translation accounting:**
- FX conversion and **repatriation of profits** from Chinese subsidiaries require SAFE approval; timing of approval affects which exchange rate is used in translation.
- **Intercompany loans** (cross-border): SAFE registration required; loan principal and interest repatriation subject to SAFE approval and registration — affects the characterization of the loan (short-term trade payable vs. long-term investment-nature loan under IAS 21.32).
- **Capital account transactions**: foreign direct investment receipts and equity capital repatriation require SAFE approval; timing impacts the historical rate used for equity layer.
- Source: SAFE Regulations on Foreign Exchange Administration — https://www.safe.gov.cn/en/

### India — FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) and RBI

**Relevant to FX translation accounting:**
- **Capital account transactions** (equity investment, external commercial borrowings — ECB): require RBI approval or registration under FEMA 1999.
- **ECB regulations**: Indian entities borrowing from foreign parents must comply with RBI ECB Master Direction; the drawn-down currency affects functional currency indicators.
- **Repatriation of dividends**: permissible subject to compliance with Companies Act and FEMA; timing affects average rate vs. declaration-date rate application.
- **Compounding**: FEMA violations may result in compounding proceedings — advisors should flag FEMA compliance when advising on FX-denominated intragroup structures.
- Source: RBI Master Directions on External Commercial Borrowings — https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx

### Brazil — IOF and SPED

**IOF (Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras — Tax on Financial Transactions):**
- IOF applies to FX conversion transactions (IOF/Câmbio); current rate varies by transaction type (capital inflows, loans, equity).
- IOF on cross-border loans affects the effective interest cost, which may affect functional currency indicators (financing cost currency).
- Source: Receita Federal — https://www.gov.br/receitafederal/en/subjects/taxes/iof

**SPED (Sistema Público de Escrituração Digital):**
- Brazilian entities must maintain accounting records in BRL and file SPED (ECD — Electronic Accounting Bookkeeping) in BRL regardless of group reporting currency.
- If a Brazilian subsidiary's functional currency is USD (e.g., due to USD-denominated operations), the entity still maintains statutory BRL books and remeasures to USD for group consolidation — a two-step process.
