# Business Combinations Advisor — Reference Skill

## Purpose

Provide the complete multi-jurisdiction framework for business combinations advisory — from acquirer identification and acquisition date determination through purchase price allocation, goodwill measurement, NCI, deferred tax in PPA, post-combination accounting, and common-control transactions.

## Part 1: The Acquisition Method — ASC 805 / IFRS 3

### Step 1: Identify the Acquirer

The acquirer is the entity that obtains control of the acquiree (ASC 805-10-55 / IFRS 3.B14–B18).

**Reverse acquisition indicators** (when legal acquiree is the accounting acquirer):
- The former owners of the legal acquiree obtain the majority of the voting rights of the combined entity.
- The composition of the governing body is dominated by former owners of the legal acquiree.
- Management of the legal acquiree comprises the majority of management of the combined entity.
- The combination is effected at a premium over the fair value of the legal acquirer.
- The larger entity is the legal acquiree.

Source: ASC 805-10-55-11 / IFRS 3.B14–B18

### Step 2: Determine the Acquisition Date

The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer obtains control — generally the closing date when consideration is transferred and the acquiree's assets are received and liabilities assumed (ASC 805-10-25-6 / IFRS 3.9).

### Step 3: Recognise and Measure Identifiable Assets and Liabilities

At the acquisition date, recognise:
- **All identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed** that meet the Framework definitions, even if not recognised by the acquiree (e.g., internally developed intangibles).
- **At fair value** as of the acquisition date, except for specific exceptions (e.g., deferred tax — IAS 12/ASC 740; employee benefits — IAS 19/ASC 715; operating leases — IFRS 16/ASC 842).
- **No recognition** of restructuring provisions or future losses of the acquiree as of the acquisition date (ASC 805-20-25-1 / IFRS 3.11).

## Part 2: Consideration Transferred and PPA

### Consideration Components

| Component | Measurement | Key Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cash | Face value | Straightforward |
| Equity issued | Fair value of shares at **acquisition date** market price | Not at announcement date |
| Contingent consideration | **Fair value at acquisition date** | Subsequent changes through P&L (not goodwill) under ASC 805-30-35 / IFRS 3.58 |
| Replacement awards (share-based) | Portion attributable to pre-combination service = purchase price; portion for post-combination service = compensation cost | ASC 805-30-25-3 / IFRS 3.B55–B62 |

### Step Acquisitions (Business Combination Achieved in Stages)

1. Remeasure the previously held equity interest in the acquiree to **fair value at the acquisition date**.
2. Recognise the resulting gain or loss in P&L.
3. Include that remeasured fair value in the consideration transferred to calculate goodwill.

Source: ASC 805-10-25-10 / IFRS 3.42

### Contingent Consideration — Post-Acquisition Remeasurement

- Equity-classified contingent consideration: **Not remeasured** (settled in own shares, classified as equity).
- Liability-classified contingent consideration: **Remeasured at fair value each reporting date; change goes through P&L**.
- Common error: routing post-acquisition changes in contingent consideration to goodwill (prohibited under both ASC 805 and IFRS 3).

## Part 3: Identifiable Intangibles

### Recognition Criteria (ASC 805-20 / IFRS 3.B31–B40)

Recognise separately from goodwill if the asset meets either:
- **Separability criterion**: can be separated from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged.
- **Contractual-legal criterion**: arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of separability.

### Common Intangibles Recognised in PPA

| Category | Examples | Typical Valuation Method |
|---|---|---|
| Customer-related | Customer lists, customer relationships, order backlog | Multi-period excess earnings (MPEEM) |
| Technology-based | Developed technology, patents, databases | Relief from royalty; cost approach |
| Marketing-related | Trade names, trademarks, internet domain names | Relief from royalty |
| Contract-based | Licensing agreements, non-compete agreements, franchise agreements | Incremental cash flow approach |
| Artistic-related | Copyrights, literary works | Relief from royalty |

### In-Process Research & Development (IPR&D)

| Standard | Treatment |
|---|---|
| ASC 805 (US GAAP) | Capitalise as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at acquisition date; do not amortise until project complete or abandoned; test for impairment annually (ASC 805-20-25-9) |
| IFRS 3 | Recognise at fair value if it meets identifiability criteria; capitalise if criteria in IAS 38.57 are met (technical feasibility, intention to complete, ability to use/sell, probable future economic benefits, adequate resources); expense if criteria not met |

## Part 4: Goodwill

### Goodwill Calculation

```
Goodwill = Consideration Transferred
         + Fair Value of NCI
         + Fair Value of Previously Held Interest (if step acquisition)
         − Fair Value of Net Identifiable Assets Acquired
```

### Full Goodwill vs. Partial Goodwill (IFRS 3.19)

| Method | US GAAP | IFRS 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Full goodwill | **Required**: NCI measured at FV → goodwill includes NCI's share | **Choice** (election per transaction): NCI at FV |
| Partial goodwill | Not permitted | **Choice** (election per transaction): NCI at proportionate share of net identifiable assets → goodwill = only acquirer's share |

**Impact**: Full goodwill increases both goodwill and NCI on the balance sheet. Impairment losses on full-goodwill entities are allocated between the parent and NCI.

### Bargain Purchase (Negative Goodwill)

If consideration + NCI FV + previously held interest < fair value of net identifiable assets:
1. Reassess fair values of all identified assets and liabilities.
2. If a deficit remains after reassessment, recognise a **gain in P&L** at the acquisition date.

Source: ASC 805-30-25-2 / IFRS 3.34–36

### Goodwill Subsequent Accounting

| Standard | Subsequent Measurement |
|---|---|
| US GAAP (ASC 350-20) | **No amortisation**; annual impairment test (or more frequently if triggering events occur); private companies may elect amortisation over 10 years (ASU 2014-02) |
| IFRS (IAS 36) | **No amortisation**; annual impairment test; impairment losses not reversed |
| German HGB | **Amortise** over useful life (default 10 years if not reliably estimable) |
| JGAAP (ASBJ No.21) | **Amortise** over ≤ 20 years on a straight-line basis |
| CAS 20 (China) | **No amortisation**; annual impairment test (similar to IFRS) |
| Ind AS 103 | **No amortisation**; annual impairment (identical to IFRS 3 / IAS 36) |

---

## Part 5: Non-Controlling Interests (NCI)

| Option | Measurement | Goodwill Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Fair value (full goodwill) | NCI FV = NCI % × implied entity value | Full goodwill includes NCI's proportionate share |
| Proportionate share of net identifiable assets | NCI % × FV of net identifiable assets | Partial goodwill = only acquirer's share |

**IFRS 3.19 choice** is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis; an entity may use full goodwill for one acquisition and partial for another.

US GAAP requires full goodwill in all cases (ASC 805-20-30-7).

---

## Part 6: Deferred Tax in Purchase Price Allocation

**No initial recognition exception in business combinations** (ASC 740-10-25-16 / IAS 12.15 exception does not apply to business combinations).

### Key Steps

1. **Identify temporary differences** created by fair value step-ups (e.g., intangibles stepped up above tax basis).
2. **Recognise deferred tax liability** on the fair value excess over tax basis of acquired assets.
3. **Gross up the intangible**: The DTA/DTL from the step-up changes the fair value allocation and goodwill.
   - Example: Intangible FV = $100, tax basis = $0. DTL at 25% = $25. Intangible reported = $100; DTL = $25; goodwill increases by $25 (to absorb the DTL).
4. **No iterative calculation required** under ASC 740; under IAS 12, the gross-up creates a circular calculation that must be resolved directly.

## Part 7: Post-Combination Accounting

### Integration Costs

Acquisition-related costs (advisory fees, legal fees, due diligence) are **expensed as incurred** — not added to consideration transferred (ASC 805-10-25-23 / IFRS 3.53).

Restructuring costs expected post-acquisition are **expensed as incurred** in post-combination periods. They are not recognised as a liability at acquisition date unless the acquiree had an existing obligation at the acquisition date.

### Pre-Existing Relationships

If the acquirer and acquiree had a pre-existing relationship (e.g., supplier contract, licensing arrangement):
- Settle the relationship separately from the business combination.
- Gain/loss on settlement recognised in P&L.
- Do not include in consideration transferred.

Source: ASC 805-10-25-20 / IFRS 3.B50–B53

### Indemnification Assets

If the seller contractually indemnifies the acquirer for a specific uncertainty (e.g., contingent liability): Recognise an indemnification asset at the same amount as the indemnified item. Measure on the same basis as the indemnified liability (ASC 805-20-25-27 / IFRS 3.27–28).

### Measurement Period Adjustments

**Measurement period**: Up to 12 months after the acquisition date to finalise the PPA (ASC 805-10-25-13 / IFRS 3.45).

- **Provisional PPA**: Recognise provisional amounts where fair values are not yet determined.
- **Adjustments**: Retrospectively adjust provisional amounts; restate comparatives.
- **After measurement period closes**: Changes are recognised prospectively in P&L (not retrospective).

**M&A closes mid-quarter-close — adversarial scenario**:
- Flag new entity in consolidation system immediately on acquisition date.
- Apply provisional PPA; do not delay consolidation.
- Restate prior-period comparatives when final PPA adjustments are made within the measurement period.
- Deferred tax on provisional intangibles: use best estimate; adjust when final PPA received.

## Part 8: Common Control Transactions

| Framework | Treatment |
|---|---|
| US GAAP (ASC 805-50) | **Predecessor / historical cost basis** — no fair value step-up; financial statements restated for all periods presented as if combination occurred at earliest period shown |
| IFRS | **No specific standard**; entity applies a policy choice (historical cost or acquisition method); IFRIC agenda decision (2019) confirmed acquisition method is permitted but not required |
| German HGB | Pooling of interests (Interessenzusammenführung) abolished; Erwerbsmethode (acquisition method) required for all business combinations including some common control |
| JGAAP (ASBJ No.21) | Common control transactions: carrying amount (historical cost) basis |
| CAS 20 | Common control: carrying amount basis; non-common control: acquisition method |
| Ind AS 103 | No guidance on common control transactions; entities typically apply predecessor basis |

---

## Part 9: Joint Ventures and Joint Operations

| Type | US GAAP | IFRS |
|---|---|---|
| Joint venture | ASC 323: **equity method** | IFRS 11: **mandatory equity method** (proportionate consolidation not permitted for JVs) |
| Joint operation | Proportionate share of assets/liabilities/revenue/expenses | IFRS 11: proportionate share (same) |
| Key standard | ASC 323-10 / ASC 808 | IFRS 11.24–26 |

---

## Part 10: Multi-Jurisdiction Summary

| Jurisdiction | Standard | Key Differences vs. IFRS 3 |
|---|---|---|
| US GAAP | ASC 805/350/720 | Full goodwill required; IPR&D capitalised; no goodwill amortisation; acquisition costs expensed |
| IFRS | IFRS 3/IAS 27/28/36 | Full or partial goodwill choice; IPR&D may be expensed; no amortisation |
| German HGB | HGB §§ 301–309 | Goodwill amortised (≤10 years default); simpler intangible identification rules |
| JGAAP | ASBJ No.21 | Goodwill amortised (≤20 years straight-line); pooling abolished 2008 |
| China CAS 20 | CAS 20 | Common control: carrying amount; non-common: acquisition method; no goodwill amortisation |
| Ind AS 103 | Ind AS 103 | Identical to IFRS 3; no amortisation of goodwill |
