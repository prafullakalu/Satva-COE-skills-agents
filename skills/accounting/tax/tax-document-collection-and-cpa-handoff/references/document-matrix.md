## Cross-Reference Rules

Use these rules to infer expected documents from a taxpayer's profile. Each rule follows the pattern: **if the profile includes X, then expect Y**.

### Income Sources

- **If profile has an employer** → expect one W-2 per employer. If job changed mid-year, expect multiple W-2s.
- **If profile has freelance/contract income** → expect one 1099-NEC per client paying $600+. Also expect to prepare Schedule C.
- **If profile has K-1 sources** → expect one K-1 per partnership, S-corp, or LLC. Flag as potential late arrival (Mar-Sep). Consider whether a personal extension (Form 4868) is needed.
- **If profile receives Social Security** → expect SSA-1099.
- **If profile received unemployment** → expect 1099-G from the state.

### Investment & Banking

- **If profile has bank or savings accounts** → expect 1099-INT per institution (if interest exceeds $10). High-yield savings accounts almost always generate one.
- **If profile has brokerage accounts** → expect consolidated 1099 (1099-B + 1099-DIV + 1099-INT) per brokerage. Wait until mid-March for final/corrected versions before filing.
- **If profile has cryptocurrency holdings with sales or rewards** → expect 1099-B or 1099-MISC per exchange, but verify completeness against personal records.
- **If profile has stock compensation (RSU/ESPP)** → expect both a W-2 (with compensation income) and a 1099-B from the administering broker. Cross-reference to ensure cost basis is correctly adjusted.

### Real Estate

- **If profile has a primary residence with a mortgage** → expect one 1098 from the mortgage servicer.
- **If profile has rental properties** → expect one 1098 per mortgaged rental property + property tax records from the county. If rent is collected through a platform, may also receive 1099-K.
- **If profile sold real estate during the year** → expect 1099-S from the title company (unless exclusion was certified at closing). Retain the closing disclosure for gain/loss calculation.
- **If profile has multiple rental properties** → expect Schedule E with one section per property. Collect rent rolls, expense receipts, and depreciation schedules per property.

### Health & Benefits

- **If profile has an HSA** → expect 1099-SA (distributions) and 5498-SA (contributions, arrives late). Cross-reference W-2 Box 12 Code W for employer contributions.
- **If profile purchased health insurance through the marketplace** → expect 1095-A. Required for filing — do not file without it.
- **If profile works for a large employer (ALE)** → may receive 1095-C. Retain for records.

### Education

- **If profile (or dependent) attended college/university** → expect 1098-T. Needed for education credits.
- **If profile is repaying student loans** → expect 1098-E if interest paid exceeds $600. Interest may still be deductible below that threshold.

### Debt & Government

- **If profile had debt cancelled or forgiven** → expect 1099-C. Evaluate insolvency or bankruptcy exclusion.
- **If profile received a state/local tax refund** → expect 1099-G. Only relevant if the taxpayer itemized in the prior year.

## Filing Readiness Checklist

A return is **ready to file** when:

1. All expected W-2s and 1099s have been received (cross-reference against prior year).
2. Brokerage statements are marked "final" or "corrected" (not "preliminary").
3. All K-1s have been received — or a decision to extend has been made.
4. 1095-A is in hand (if marketplace insurance was used).
5. RSU/ESPP cost basis has been cross-referenced between W-2 and 1099-B.
