# CPA Handoff Format — Output Specification

This reference defines the structure of the CPA handoff package generated in Phase 5.

Write the package into the tax year's working folder.

---

## Primary Output: Single Structured Document

The default CPA package is a single markdown file (`cpa-package.md`) containing all
11 sections below. This is the most practical format:
- Readable in any text editor or browser
- Copy-pasteable into email for CPA
- Renderable in most document viewers
- Contains all the same data as the CSV files

Structure the markdown file with:
- H1: "Tax Year {year} — CPA Package for {name}"
- H2: Each of the 11 sections below
- Tables for tabular data (markdown tables)
- Bullet lists for open questions and notes
- Bold for key amounts and flags
- A "Document Checklist" section with ✓/✗ status markers

The CSV files (detailed below) are a secondary output for users who prefer spreadsheets.
A multi-tab spreadsheet with the same sections is an acceptable alternative.

---

## CPA Cover Letter

Include a brief cover letter at the top of the CPA package summarizing: filing status, states filed, 2-3 notable items this year, count of open questions for CPA review, and document completeness (received/total). Pull notable items from the session notes entries of type "cpa_note" and "decision". Claude should write this naturally — no rigid template needed.
