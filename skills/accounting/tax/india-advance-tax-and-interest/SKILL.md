  Estimate current-year income, build the advance tax instalment schedule, compute interest u/s 234A, 234B and 234C with a script, tie every challan to 26AS, and prepare the e-Pay Tax challan (advance tax 100, self-assessment 300, regular assessment 400) for the CA to pay. Covers the 44AD/44ADA single instalment, resident senior citizens, and 234C relief for capital gains arising later in the year. Typical asks: "advance tax kitna bharna hai", "15 December ki installment", "234B 234C interest nikalo", "self assessment tax challan bana do", "challan 26AS me nahi dikh raha".

# Advance tax and interest under 234A, 234B and 234C


## Do the work, then stop at the payment

The estimate, the instalment working, the interest computation, the challan tie-out and the filled e-Pay Tax
screen are yours. **You never pay.** The CA presses Pay and completes the bank authentication. Refusing the
working because the payment is theirs is a failure. Say where you will stop, then start.

## Step 0 — fix the year, and say which one you are in

FY is April to March; AY = FY + 1. Advance tax is paid **during** the FY on that FY's income; self-assessment
tax after it ends. Both carry the same AY on the challan and are told apart only by the minor head — get that
wrong and the credit lands in the wrong bucket. State at the top of every working: the FY, the AY, the date you
are computing as at, and whether the figures are estimated or actual.

## Step 1 — estimate the current-year income

A forecast, and it must say so on its face. Build it from evidence, not from last year scaled up.

| Head | Evidence | Trap |
|---|---|---|
| Salary | Payslips to date projected for the balance, the employer's TDS projection | Bonus, arrears, ESOP perquisite, mid-year job change |
| House property | Rent agreement, interest certificate | Vacancy; a let-out treated as self-occupied |
| Business or profession | Books to date, prior-year pattern, GST turnover as a cross-check | Year-end provisions, depreciation not yet booked |
| Capital gains | Broker statements to date | A gain arising **after** an instalment date changes 234C — record each date |
| Other sources | Interest accrued, dividend credited, AIS to date | Interest accrued but not yet credited |

Take only deductions the assessee can substantiate today, not what they intend to invest by March;
intentions go in the assumptions block, never into a figure. Compute under the regime that will actually apply
and say which. Slabs, rebate, surcharge and cess come from the Finance Act and CBDT notifications for that AY (record the source and date) — **never from memory and never from last year's working paper.** Use a
spreadsheet with live formulas for the estimate.

## Step 2 — the instalment schedule

The schedule is a sequence of cut-off dates in the FY, each with a cumulative percentage of the year's
estimated liability. The structure is stable; **the dates and percentages are not yours to state from
memory.** Look them up for that FY (Income-tax Act section 211 and the e-filing portal) and record each in **Rules used** before computing. Under section 211 as it
stood for recent years they were 15 June / 15 September / 15 December / 15 March at 15% / 45% / 75% / 100% —
confirm for the year.

Two variations rewrite the whole schedule and must be verified rather than assumed:

- Assessees declaring presumptive income under 44AD(1) or 44ADA(1) pay the whole advance tax by 15 March in
  one instalment. This does not extend to 44AE.
- A resident individual aged 60 or more with no business or profession income is outside advance tax (section
  207(2)).

Both are eligibility conditions — confirm each for that year and cite it.

Build one row per instalment: cut-off date, cumulative percentage, cumulative tax required, paid to date,
shortfall. The percentages apply to tax on estimated total income less the TDS and TCS genuinely expected —
take that from 26AS plus what is realistic; an optimistic TDS assumption creates 234B.

## Step 3 — check what has been paid, against 26AS, not against the client

Never compute a shortfall against what the client says they paid. Download 26AS for the AY (income-tax portal: Form 26AS / AIS) and read the advance tax and self-assessment tax part. Record
BSR code, challan serial, date of deposit, amount, minor head and AY for each, tie each to an instalment by
its deposit date, then flag:

- A challan in the folder but not in 26AS — not yet reported, or carrying the wrong PAN or AY. It is not paid
  until it appears. A challan in 26AS under the wrong AY or minor head needs a challan correction, not a second
  payment. Look up the current correction route and its time limit for that challan (portal service,
  bank or assessing officer) before advising.
- A payment made after a cut-off — it counts from its actual date, not the date intended.

## Step 4 — the interest computations

Compute each separately and show the workings. All three are simple interest on a base, for months, at a rate
the Act fixes. **The rate, the rounding and the part-month convention are rules, not memory** — look each up
and record it before multiplying.

| Section | Charged for | Base | Period runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 234A | Filing after the due date | Tax on total income less TDS/TCS, advance tax and reliefs (tax paid by the due date reduces it) | Day after the due date to the date of filing |
| 234B | Advance tax paid is less than the required share of assessed tax (90% in recent years) | Assessed tax less advance tax paid | First day of the AY to assessment or payment, on the reducing balance |
| 234C | Missing an instalment even where the year total is met | The shortfall at each cut-off | A fixed number of months per instalment |

Verify per year: the threshold below which advance tax is not required at all (₹10,000 in recent years), the
tolerances that excuse a 234C charge on the first two instalments (12% and 36% in recent years), and the relief
where the shortfall comes from income that could not have been estimated at the earlier cut-off — capital
gains, dividends, lottery, a first year of business — which applies only if the tax on it is paid in the
remaining instalments or by 31 March. That is why Step 1 asked for the date of each gain.

Run the script rather than multiplying by hand (individual assessees; for others use a spreadsheet with the
same logic):

```bash
python3 scripts/compute_interest_234.py --tax 150000 --tds 120000 --fy 2025-26 \
  --pay-date 2026-07-30 --due-date 2026-07-31 --file-date 2026-07-30 \
  --age 45 [--non-resident] [--has-business-income] [--presumptive 44AD|44ADA] \
  --advance 2025-09-10:5000 2025-12-12:4000 \
  --payment 2026-05-02:20000 \
  --income-event 2025-11-20:30000 \
  --total-income 1450000 --rate 0.01 --threshold 10000
```

- `--tax` total liability including surcharge and cess; `--tds` TDS + TCS as in 26AS.
- `--advance DATE:AMT` advance-tax challans up to 31 March; `--payment DATE:AMT` self-assessment payments after
  31 March (234B runs on the reducing balance).
- `--income-event DATE:TAX` tax on income that arose on that date (the 234C proviso relief; the script prints a
  VERIFY line reminding you of its condition).
- `--rate` and `--threshold` are defaults — pass the verified values.

The script rounds the base down to the nearest ₹100 and counts a part month as a full month; confirm both
conventions for the year. Read its output as it is. Show 234C instalment by instalment, never as one figure — a
single number cannot be checked by the CA. If tax is still unpaid, state the rupees per month it grows.

## Step 5 — prepare the challan for the CA to pay

The CA logs in to incometax.gov.in -> e-File -> e-Pay Tax -> New Payment. Give the CA these values to enter:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| PAN and name | From the PAN card; check how it renders on the confirm screen |
| Assessment Year | The AY, not the FY |
| Type of payment (minor head) | Advance Tax (100) during the year, Self-Assessment Tax (300) after it, Tax on Regular Assessment (400) against a demand — confirm the label on screen before selecting |
| Tax, then surcharge, cess, interest, penalty, fee | Each in its own box, split exactly as in the working |

Never lump interest into the tax box; a challan split wrongly reconciles badly for years. Then stop at the
gateway — bank sign-in, OTP and the Pay click are the CA's. State the exact total, the minor head and the AY,
and ask for the challan details (BSR code, challan serial / CIN, date) back for the working and the return
(Schedule IT).

## Output and handover

In `<Client>/<FY>/ITR/`, dated, with PAN and AY in the name: the estimate with its assumptions block, the
instalment table, the 26AS challan tie-out, the interest workings section by section (script output attached),
and a one-page payment instruction with the exact amount and heads — never a payment. Hand over the amount, the
minor head, the AY, the date by which paying stops further interest, and what is estimated versus actual, said
plainly.

- **Check before paying**: the AY on the challan is the AY of the working; the minor head matches the purpose;
  the tax / interest split matches the working; the TDS assumed is what 26AS supports; every gain date used for
  234C relief comes from a broker statement in the folder.
- A **Rules used** block for every date, percentage, rate, threshold and tolerance, with source URL and date
  checked, or marked "confirm on the portal / notification" with the section it comes from.
