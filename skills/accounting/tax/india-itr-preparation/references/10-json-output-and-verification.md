# Phase 7 — Output: Data-Pack JSON and Verifying a Portal JSON

## Deliverable A — the data pack (default output)

One annotated JSON file the user can hand to any assistant (or read themselves) to fill the portal
mechanically. Save to the user's Downloads/working directory, named
`ITR_datapack_<PAN>_AY<year>.json`. Validate it parses after writing.

Required top-level sections (include only those relevant to the profile, but never omit a relevant one):

```jsonc
{
  "_README": "what this is, AY, form, who prepared it, reconciliation status",
  "rules_verification": { "one row per rate/limit/date used anywhere in this pack:
                           { rule, value_used, source_url, checked_on } — e.g. slab table, standard
                           deduction, 87A threshold, CG rates, 112A exemption, surcharge tiers, audit
                           limit, due date. Official sources (incometaxindia.gov.in / incometax.gov.in)
                           preferred; a rule with no row here means it was NOT verified — fix before

```

Conventions: amounts INR integers (paise only where source has them), dates YYYY-MM-DD, every figure
traceable to the Phase 2/3 ledger, `TODO`/`VERIFY` prefixes for anything only the user can confirm.
The final chat message must list all open TODO/VERIFY items — the pack is not "done" while any remain.

**Validate the JSON parses after every single edit, not just at the end.** These packs grow to
hundreds of lines with deep nesting; one misplaced brace from a mid-file insertion breaks the whole
file silently until something tries to parse it. Run
`python3 -c "import json; json.load(open(path))"` (or equivalent) immediately after each write —
catching a syntax error right after the edit that caused it is far cheaper than debugging it later
once several more edits have piled on top.

## Deliverable B — verifying an official ITR JSON (portal/utility export)

The portal's JSON is `{"ITR": {"ITR3": {...schedules...}}}` (or ITR1/2/4). Schedule names:
`PartA_GEN1` (personal + filing status + regime flags `Form10IEAEarlierAYOldRegime`/`F10IEACurrAYOldRegime`),
`ScheduleS`, `ScheduleHP`, `ScheduleCGFor23` + `ScheduleSI` (special incomes), `ITR3ScheduleBP`,
`PARTA_PL`/`TradingAccount`/`PARTA_BS`, `ScheduleOS`, `ScheduleCYLA/BFLA/CFL`, `ScheduleVIA`,
`ScheduleFA/FSI/TR`, `ScheduleTDS1/TDS2/TCS/IT`, `PartB-TI`, `PartB_TTI`, `Verification`.
Schedule/field names drift across AYs — treat this list as the AY 2026-27 shape and re-derive the
actual names from the JSON in hand.

Verification procedure:
1. Parse and extract every material leaf: salary per TAN, exemptions, each OS line, CG rows, BP totals,
   CYLA/CFL, `PartB-TI.TotalIncome`, `PartB_TTI` tax/interest/`BalTaxPayable`, bank accounts, TDS rows.
2. **Recompute independently from source documents** (never from the JSON's own intermediate figures)
   and diff line by line.
3. For every mismatch report: field, JSON value, your value, source evidence, ₹ impact, and whether it
   over- or under-reports income. A figure in the JSON with NO source (e.g., an interest line you can't
   find in AIS/26AS) is a first-class finding — ask the user, don't assume either way; it may come from
   a source you weren't given (26AS refund interest is the classic).
4. Check structural traps: single standard deduction; regime flags consistent with the chosen regime;
   losses in CFL only if due date holds; `SelfAssessmentTax` > 0 and CIN present if there was a payable;
   dividend quarterwise filled; 112A scripwise present; Chapter VI-A total ≤ gross total income and
   nothing regime-invalid claimed; **Schedule AL present if total income exceeds its threshold**;
   Schedule FA present if ROR with foreign assets; TCS credits from 26AS claimed; agri > ₹5,000 not
   sitting in an ITR-1/4.
5. When two JSONs exist (user edited something), flat-diff them (`old vs new leaves`) and report what
   changed, whether it was needed, and the ₹ impact — users often make cosmetic edits they think are
   substantive and vice versa.

**Reconciliation technique — decompose the gap, don't re-derive from scratch.** When the user reports
"the refund/payable I see doesn't match what you computed," the fast path is: take the observed ₹
delta and explain it as a small number of named, individually-verifiable components (a missing
schedule entry, an unclaimed credit, a relief pending a prerequisite filing) rather than recomputing
the whole return from zero. Confirm the components sum to (approximately) the observed gap before
presenting the explanation — that sum check is what turns a guess into a verified finding.

## Deliverable C — final pre-submission diff against the portal's own generated JSON (strongly recommended)

After the user has entered everything on the portal and it validates cleanly (no schedule errors),
most portal/utility flows generate a JSON at that point, before final submission. **Offer this proactively as the
standard closing step — don't wait to be asked.** It is not a completion gate: if the user takes the
data pack and files independently, put the recommendation in the pre-filing checklist and close cleanly. It is the only artifact that
reflects exactly what the department will actually receive, including anything the portal itself
silently defaulted or omitted (a credit schedule left empty despite the underlying figure existing in
AIS/26AS; a relief not yet reflected pending a prerequisite filing like Form 67).

Run the same procedure as Deliverable B against it. Frame this to the user as a routine last check
before an action that's hard to walk back cleanly, not as a sign something is expected to be wrong.

## Handing off the portal data entry

Don't make the user assemble the handoff themselves. **End your final message with a short filing note**
pre-filled with this filer's actual pack filename, AY, and any case-specific flags (e.g. "has
csv_ready_112A — use the CSV template route", open VERIFY items), in a copyable block, to give to whoever
enters the data on the portal along with the pack.

End the note — and your own closing words to the user — with the stay-in-the-loop close:
- "Once the portal data entry is done and the portal validates, download the portal's JSON and
  bring it back to me — I'll reconcile it line-by-line against the pack (Deliverable C) and give you
  a final sign-off before you pay and submit."
- "If validation errors pop up, either let the agent fix them, or send me a screenshot and I'll fix
  it or tell the agent exactly what to do."
You are the user's preparer until the return is filed — the handoff delegates data entry, not
responsibility.
