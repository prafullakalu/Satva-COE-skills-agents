# Home Office Deduction

Calculate the business use of home deduction for self-employed individuals who work from home. This flows to Schedule C Line 30 via Form 8829.

## Do you qualify?

Two requirements must both be met:

**Regular use** — You use the space for business on a regular basis. Occasional or incidental use doesn't count. Working from home most days of the week qualifies. Working from home once a month does not.

**Exclusive use** — The space is used exclusively for business. This is the requirement most people fail. A spare bedroom used only as your office qualifies. A kitchen table where you also eat dinner does not. A room that doubles as a guest bedroom does not. A dedicated desk in the corner of a room can qualify if that area is used for nothing else — but the IRS interprets this strictly.

**Exception to exclusive use:** If you use part of your home to store inventory or product samples, and your home is the sole fixed location of your business, the exclusive use test doesn't apply to the storage area. Daycare facilities also have a partial exception.

**Additional requirement for employees:** If you're a W-2 employee working from home, the home office deduction is NOT available on your federal return since TCJA 2018 (some states still allow it). This deduction is only for self-employed individuals (Schedule C filers) and certain statutory employees.

## Method 1: Simplified method

The easy option. No tracking of actual home expenses required.

**Calculation:** $5 × square footage of your dedicated home office space, up to 300 square feet maximum.

**Maximum deduction:** $5 × 300 = **$1,500 per year**.

**Advantages:** No need to calculate actual expenses, no depreciation (which means no depreciation recapture if you sell your home later), no Form 8829 required, easy to calculate.

**Disadvantages:** The $1,500 cap leaves money on the table for people with high mortgage/rent or large offices. You can't carry forward any unused portion. You can still deduct mortgage interest and property taxes on Schedule A (they're not "used up" by the simplified method).

**Election:** You choose the method each year. You can use simplified this year and actual next year. The election is made simply by which method you use on the return.

## Method 2: Actual expense method (Form 8829)

More paperwork, often a larger deduction.

### Step 1: Calculate business-use percentage

**Square footage method (most common):**
Business-use % = Office square footage ÷ Total home square footage

Example: 200 sq ft office ÷ 1,800 sq ft home = 11.11%

**Room count method (alternative):**
If rooms are roughly equal size: Number of rooms used for business ÷ Total rooms

Example: 1 office room ÷ 8 total rooms = 12.5%

Use whichever method gives you the more accurate (and typically larger) percentage, but be prepared to support it.

### Step 2: Categorize home expenses

Expenses fall into three categories:

**Direct expenses** — Benefit only the office space. Painting the office, repairs to the office, built-in shelving for the office. 100% deductible as a business expense. These are relatively rare.

**Indirect expenses** — Benefit the entire home. These get multiplied by your business-use percentage.

| Expense | Typical annual amount | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| Rent | $12,000–$36,000+ | Your full rent × business-use % |
| Mortgage interest | Varies | Only the interest portion, not principal |
| Property taxes | $2,000–$15,000+ | Real estate taxes on the home |
| Homeowner's/renter's insurance | $1,000–$3,000+ | |
| Utilities | $2,000–$5,000+ | Electric, gas, water, trash |
| Internet | $600–$1,200 | Business-use % (often higher than the home % if internet is primarily for work) |
| Home repairs and maintenance | Varies | General repairs that benefit the whole home |
| HOA fees | Varies | If applicable |
| Depreciation of home | See below | Owners only, not renters |
| Pest control | $200–$600 | |
| Security system | $200–$600 | |

**Unrelated expenses** — Benefit only non-business areas. Landscaping the front yard, remodeling the kitchen. Not deductible as a business expense (unless your business is landscaping and you're using the yard as a demo).

### Step 3: Calculate depreciation (homeowners only)

If you own your home and use the actual method, you must depreciate the business portion. This is required, not optional.

**Basis for depreciation:** The lesser of: (a) the home's fair market value when you started using it for business, or (b) the adjusted basis of the home (usually purchase price + improvements − any casualty losses). Subtract the value of the land (land is not depreciable).

**Depreciation period:** 39 years (nonresidential real property rate, straight-line) for the business portion.

**Example:** Home value (excluding land) of $300,000 × 11.11% business use = $33,330 depreciable basis. Annual depreciation: $33,330 ÷ 39 = $854.62 per year.

**Important warning — depreciation recapture:** When you sell your home, you must "recapture" the depreciation you took (or were entitled to take) as ordinary income, taxed at up to 25%. This happens even if you used the simplified method in some years (for years you used actual, the depreciation is recaptured). This is the main reason some people prefer the simplified method — it avoids depreciation entirely.

### Step 4: Apply the deduction limit

The home office deduction cannot create or increase a business loss. It's limited to your gross income from the business minus all other business expenses. If your business barely breaks even, the home office deduction may be limited.

Any disallowed amount carries forward to next year (this is an advantage over the simplified method, which has no carryforward).

### Step 5: Complete Form 8829

Form 8829 walks through this calculation. The result flows to Schedule C Line 30. Key lines:

- Line 1: Area used regularly and exclusively for business
- Line 2: Total area of home
- Line 3: Business percentage (Line 1 ÷ Line 2)
- Lines 9–21: Allowable expenses (direct + indirect × percentage)
- Line 36: Allowable deduction (subject to income limitation)

## Which method should you use?

**Use simplified if:** Your office is small (<150 sq ft), your rent/mortgage is low, you don't want the paperwork, you're concerned about depreciation recapture when selling your home, or the $1,500 max is close enough to the actual calculation.

**Use actual if:** Your office is large, your housing costs are high (HCOL area), you want to maximize the deduction, you have significant direct expenses (office renovation), or you're renting (no depreciation recapture concern).

**Quick comparison example:** 200 sq ft office in a 1,600 sq ft apartment with $2,400/month rent:

- Simplified: 200 × $5 = $1,000 (capped at 200 sq ft × $5)
- Actual: 12.5% × ($28,800 rent + $1,800 utilities + $900 insurance + $720 internet) = 12.5% × $32,220 = **$4,028**

In this case, the actual method gives 4× the deduction. Worth the extra paperwork.

## Common mistakes

**Claiming a space that isn't exclusive.** If your "office" is the dining room table, it doesn't qualify. Period. The IRS is strict on this.

**Forgetting depreciation on the actual method.** If you own and use the actual method, you must depreciate. If you skip it, the IRS will still recapture it when you sell — they assume you took it whether you did or not.

**Deducting a percentage of your entire mortgage payment.** Only the interest portion is deductible, not the principal. The principal is a balance sheet transaction (paying down a liability), not an expense.

**Using the wrong percentage for internet.** If you work from home full-time, your internet business-use percentage might be 70–80%, much higher than the square footage percentage. You can use a reasonable estimate, but document your reasoning.

**Claiming home office while also renting an office.** You can do this, but the IRS may question whether your home office is your "principal place of business." It qualifies if you use it regularly and exclusively for administrative/management activities and have no other fixed location where you conduct those activities.

## Documentation to keep

Maintain these records in case of audit: a floor plan or diagram showing the office space with measurements, photos of the dedicated space (showing it's used exclusively for business), receipts or statements for all housing expenses claimed, mortgage statements showing interest paid (separate from principal), property tax statements, utility bills, and the calculation worksheet showing how you arrived at your business-use percentage.
