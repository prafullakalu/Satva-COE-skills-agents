# Reconciliation Controls and Standards

## Control Attributes of a Complete Reconciliation
1. **Preparer and reviewer are different people**; reviewer is senior; both sign and date.
2. **Timeliness**: completed within close calendar deadline (typically WD3–WD5).
3. **Source independence**: GL balance vs. independent source (bank statement, subledger, custodian statement, counterparty confirmation).
4. **Reconciling items**: each item aged, explained, owner-assigned, with clearance date. "Unknown difference" is not an explanation.
5. **Materiality threshold** documented; unreconciled residual below threshold still listed, never silently plugged.

## Reconciling Item Categories
| Category | Example | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Timing | Deposit in transit, outstanding check | Self-clears; monitor aging |
| Error — ours | Transposition, wrong account | Correcting JE this period |
| Error — theirs | Bank error | Dispute with bank, track to resolution |
| Unidentified | Unmatched residual | Investigate; escalate if > threshold or > 30 days |

## Aging and Escalation Policy (typical)
- Items > 30 days: escalate to controller.
- Items > 60 days: written explanation to CFO.
- Items > 90 days: mandatory resolution or P&L write-off with approval.

## Red Flags (fraud-relevant)
- Recurring round-amount reconciling items.
- The same item re-explained differently across months.
- Reconciliations done but never reviewed (check reviewer timestamps).
- Suspense/clearing accounts used as permanent parking.
- Preparer with sole access to both the GL and the source system (SoD breach).
