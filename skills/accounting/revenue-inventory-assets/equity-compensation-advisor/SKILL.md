# Equity Compensation Advisor — Reference Skill

## Purpose

Provide the complete multi-jurisdiction framework for equity-based compensation advisory — from award classification and fair value measurement through vesting and expense recognition, modification accounting, tax effects, and country-specific rules.

---

## Part 1: Award Classification — ASC 718 / IFRS 2

### Equity-Classified vs. Liability-Classified Awards

| Criterion | Equity-Classified | Liability-Classified |
|---|---|---|
| Settlement | Fixed number of shares | Cash or variable number of shares |
| Cash settlement feature | Absent | Present (e.g., SARs settled in cash) |
| Indexed to own equity | Yes — no cash alternative | No — or indexed to something other than own shares |
| Key standard | ASC 718-10-25-5 / IFRS 2.8 | ASC 718-10-25-6 / IFRS 2.34 |

**Liability-classified awards** must be remeasured at fair value each reporting date until settlement. The cumulative mark-to-market is recognised in P&L.

**Modification from equity to liability** (e.g., adding a cash settlement feature): Re-measure the award at modification date fair value; any excess over grant-date fair value is recognised immediately if the modification increases fair value, or is deferred if it does not.

### Employee vs. Non-Employee Awards

| Treatment | US GAAP | IFRS 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Employee (and similar service providers) | ASC 718-10 — measure at grant date fair value | IFRS 2.10 — measure at grant date fair value of equity instrument |
| Non-employee (post-ASU 2018-07) | ASC 718 applied to non-employees; grant date is the date on which performance commitment exists | IFRS 2.12 — measured at fair value of goods/services received; equity FV used only if goods/services FV cannot be estimated |
| Key note | ASU 2018-07 aligned non-employee treatment largely with employee treatment for US GAAP | IFRS 2 non-employee measurement has always been goods/services-first |

---

## Part 2: Stock Options — Fair Value Measurement

### Valuation Models

| Model | Use Case | Key Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| Black-Scholes | Plain-vanilla options with service conditions only; no path dependency | Expected term, volatility, risk-free rate, dividend yield |
| Binomial / Lattice | Where early exercise is expected to vary; can model suboptimal exercise; options with performance conditions | Lattice of stock prices across time steps; exercise boundary calibration |
| Monte Carlo | Market conditions (TSR-based, share price hurdles); path-dependent features | Simulates thousands of price paths; outputs expected payout under the condition |

Source: ASC 718-10-55-11; IFRS 2.B5–B6; SEC SAB Topic 14.D

### Valuation Model Inputs

| Input | ASC 718 Guidance | IFRS 2 Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| Expected term | SAB Topic 14.D: simplified method = (vesting period + contractual term) ÷ 2 for plain-vanilla options; otherwise based on historical exercise data | IFRS 2.B6: based on expected early exercise behaviour; consider vesting period and contractual life |
| Volatility | Historical volatility over a period equal to expected term; implied volatility from traded options if available; peer group volatility for newly public companies (SAB Topic 14.D.1) | IFRS 2.B7: same considerations |
| Risk-free rate | US Treasury zero-coupon rate for a term equal to expected term at grant date | Government bond yield for a term equal to expected term |
| Dividend yield | Expected dividends during expected term; adjust for declared but not yet paid dividends | Same |

---

## Part 3: RSUs, PSUs, and ESPPs

### RSUs and PSUs

**RSU grant date fair value**: Closing stock price on grant date (or volume-weighted average price per plan terms); no option pricing model required.

**Dividend equivalents**: If RSUs accrue dividends as additional shares, the dividend equivalent RSUs are additional awards; if paid in cash, subtract discounted cash flows from grant date FMV.

**TSR-based PSUs** (Total Shareholder Return): Market condition → Monte Carlo simulation required. Market conditions are never "improbable" for expense recognition purposes. If the service condition is met, the full target-level expense is recognised regardless of whether the TSR threshold is achieved (ASC 718-10-25-20 / IFRS 2.21).

**Performance condition reassessment**: At each reporting date, update the probability assessment for performance conditions. Apply cumulative catch-up adjustments when probability changes. Compare to a market condition which is fixed at grant date.

**Vesting tranche accounting**:
- Straight-line: Recognise total award expense ratably over the requisite service period.
- Graded/accelerated: Recognise each tranche separately over its own vesting period (accelerated method). Required under IFRS 2.15A for awards with graded vesting; US GAAP offers a policy election.

### ESPPs (Employee Stock Purchase Plans)

| Criterion | Compensatory (ASC 718) | Non-Compensatory |
|---|---|---|
| Discount from fair value | > 5% | ≤ 5% |
| Lookback feature | Any lookback > 12 months | No lookback (or ≤ beginning-of-offering-period price with ≤ 12-month offering) |
| Section 423 qualified | Not determinative for accounting | Plan must be Section 423-qualified AND meet all non-compensatory criteria |
| Key standard | ASC 718-50-25-1 | ASC 718-50-25-2 |

For compensatory ESPPs: Measure fair value at the beginning of the offering period; use Black-Scholes with expected term = offering period length.

---

## Part 4: Forfeitures

| Treatment | ASC 718 (post-ASU 2016-09) | IFRS 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Policy choice | Elect to estimate forfeitures at grant date OR recognise expense only for vested awards (actual forfeiture method) | No choice: always estimate expected forfeitures; adjust estimate at each reporting date |
| Change in estimate | Recognised prospectively as a change in estimate | Recognised prospectively |
| Key standard | ASC 718-10-30-3 (post-ASU 2016-09 policy election) | IFRS 2.19–2.21 |

**Common error**: Applying the actual forfeiture method under US GAAP without making a formal accounting policy election, or forgetting that IFRS 2 requires forfeiture estimation.

---

## Part 5: Modification Accounting

### ASC 718 (ASC 718-20-55)

A modification is any change in terms or conditions of a share-based award. On modification date:
1. Measure grant-date fair value of the original award (if it had been unmodified).
2. Measure modification-date fair value of the modified award.
3. Any **incremental fair value** (excess of modified FV over original FV at modification date) is additional compensation cost.
4. Improbable-to-probable change: if the original award was improbable of vesting and the modification makes it probable, recognise modification-date fair value as if it were a new grant.

### IFRS 2 Modification Types (IFRS 2.27–29)

| Type | Definition | Accounting |
|---|---|---|
| Type I | Modification that increases total fair value (beneficial modification) | Recognise incremental fair value over remaining vesting period |
| Type II | Modification that increases number of equity instruments | Recognise incremental fair value of additional instruments |
| Type III | Modification that does not increase fair value or number of instruments (detrimental modification) | Continue recognising original grant-date FV; ignore modification |

**Key IFRS 2 rule**: A detrimental modification (Type III) does not reduce total compensation cost below the original grant-date fair value. The company is "locked in" to the original expense.

## Part 6: Tax Effects

### US GAAP — Post-ASU 2016-09 (ASC 718-740)

| Item | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Deferred tax asset | Recognised on book compensation expense at the corporate tax rate |
| Excess tax benefit (windfall) | Recognised in P&L (income tax benefit) when the tax deduction exceeds cumulative book expense |
| Tax shortfall | Recognised in P&L (income tax expense) when book expense exceeds tax deduction |
| Section 162(m) | $1M deduction limit for covered employees (CEO, CFO, and the next 3 highest-paid); ISO and performance-based exemptions largely eliminated for post-2017 grants under TCJA |
| ISO vs. NSO | ISO: no ordinary income on exercise (AMT applies); capital gain on qualifying disposition; no corporate deduction on qualifying disposition. NSO: ordinary income on exercise = spread; W-2 reporting; corporate deduction equal to spread |

Source: ASC 718-740-35; IRC §162(m); IRC §422; IRC §83

### IFRS 2 Tax (IAS 12 + IFRS 2.58)

- Current tax deduction based on intrinsic value of the award at the tax measurement date (typically exercise for options; vesting for RSUs) — not grant-date fair value.
- If intrinsic value > cumulative book expense: excess recognised directly in equity.
- Deferred tax asset: recognised on book expense to the extent it is probable that a future tax deduction will be available.

### Multi-Jurisdiction Tax Rules

| Jurisdiction | Key Rules |
|---|---|
| Germany | § 19a EStG (2021 reform): Deferred taxation on employee share schemes — tax on share value deferred until earliest of sale, leaving employer, or 12 years post-grant. Applies to qualifying startups and SMEs. Ordinary employment income (§ 19 EStG) applies outside § 19a scope. |
| Japan | 税制適格 (Qualified tax-favored) stock options: No tax on exercise; capital gains tax on sale. Must meet J-SOX criteria (exercise price ≥ grant price; exercise ≤ ¥12M/year; option holder is director/employee; exercise period 2–10 years post-grant). 非適格 (Non-qualified): income tax on exercise spread as employment income. |
| China | Offshore equity for domestic employees requires SAFE (State Administration of Foreign Exchange) registration (SAFE Circular 7 / Circular 37). Tax: Individual income tax on equity income treated as wages/salaries; collected by employer at exercise. |
| India | Perquisite tax on exercise: spread between FMV on exercise date and exercise price treated as salary perquisite; TDS applies at exercise. Capital gains tax on subsequent sale (LTCG/STCG). SEBI ESOP (Employee Stock Option Plan) Regulations 2021 govern listed company plan requirements. |
| UK / EU | UK: HMRC-approved schemes (EMI, CSOP, SAYE, SIP) offer tax advantages; unapproved options subject to income tax on exercise. IFRS 2 applies for IFRS reporters. |
